      <h2>What is the point of ThePartsAdvisor.com?</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal is to provide the ability to source the highest quality automotive
        parts that fit within your budget.
      </p>

      <h2>Why was it created?</h2>
      <p>
        ThePartsAdvisor.com was created because we know that money doesnt grow on trees.
        We know that car maintenance is the last thing you want to spend your hard earned money
        on. We also know the price markup that shops and dealers add on to your already high
        bill. This website was created to help save you money by sourcing it yourself in one
        easy location.
