        <dt>Why was it created?</dt>
        <dd>
          ThePartsAdviser.com was created because we know that money doesnt grow on trees.
          We know that car maintenance is the last thing you want to spend your hard earned money
          on. We also know the price markup that shops and dealers add on to your already high
          bill. This website was created to help save you money by sourcing it yourself in one
          easy location.
