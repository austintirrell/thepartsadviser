          First off I'd like to thank you for visiting my website. This site will be turned 
          in as my final project in a website design class I'm in. ThePartsAdvisor is my 
          passion project that I will continue working on long after this class. It's something 
          I would love to see become a real thing. In my personal opinion this website looks 
          bland and unfinished. I'd like to work on the design and aesthetic, as well as the 
          functionality of course. My personal goal with this website is to be able to offer 
          the ability to search and compare auto parts across most major retailers, and *maybe* 
          get a small commission on parts that are sold. If this site made enough to keep it online, 
          I will be extremely happy with it as my first big project. So from here, keep on the watch 
          as I will be continuosly updating this. Right now you might be viewing this website on 
          my student AWS account, however this will be hosted on <a href="thepartsadvisor.com">ThePartsAdvisor.com</a> 
          by the time this is submitted, and would love for you to check in. Feel free to fill out the 
          form on the contact page, and make sure to check the box to receive updates on the website if you're 
          at all interested. Thanks!!
